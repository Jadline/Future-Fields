            <p>Seasonal fruits are one of the highlights at Future Fields, providing bursts of sweetness to our harvests. Our apple orchards feature a mix of varieties, from crisp and tart to sweet and juicy. Strawberries are handpicked at their peak to ensure maximum flavor and nutrition. We also grow melons, including watermelons and cantaloupes, that thrive under our careful irrigation techniques and are cherished for their refreshing qualities during the warm months</p>
