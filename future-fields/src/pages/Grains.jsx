            <p>At Future Fields, our grain fields are a cornerstone of our agricultural operation. We cultivate wheat, corn, and barley, which serve multiple purposes from animal feed to food production. Wheat is milled into high-quality flour used for baking and cooking. Corn is grown not only for livestock feed but also for human consumption and value-added products like cornmeal. Barley, an essential grain, is used both in livestock diets and as a key ingredient for various culinary and brewing processes</p>
